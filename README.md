# ZilliLootNFT: Adventure Gear on Zilliqa Network 

ZilliLoot is a unique and randomized adventurer gear generated and stored on chain. Stats, images, and other functionality are intentionally omitted for others to interpret. This is a text based adventure which would serve the basis of the original video game. Feel free to use ZilliLoot in any way you want. 
 
Three lists have been added: "items" , "descriptors" , "descriptors2" with 24 items each. These descriptors can be used   to create unique randomized gear for each person minting an nft using 

24x24x24 = 13,824 unique items of a adventure gear can be minted using just this one contract!
Some of the unique never seen before NFTs that can be minted using this contract includes: 

*inevitable ice axe of the righteous surging*

*guardian gecko with invisible path to glory*

*treacherous helmet of evolved zombies*

*hippie pyromancer at the edge of reality*

These serve as great imagination starting point for multiple metaverses that we expect will be built using these adventure gear.


To make this possible we have modified nft minting procedure as well as transition to link the tokenuri to specific characteristics of the adventure gear. Please have a look at our file references/ZilliLootNFT.scilla 



























# ZRC
The Zilliqa Reference Contracts (ZRCs) are the contract standards for the Zilliqa platform.

# Contributing
1. Review [ZRC-0](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZRC/blob/master/zrcs/zrc-0.md).
2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
3. Add your ZRC to your fork of the repository. There is a template ZRC [here](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZRC/blob/master/zrcs/zrc-1.md).
4. Submit a Pull Request to [Zilliqa's ZRC repository](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZRC).

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final ZRC. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new ZRC and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a `discussions-to header` with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the ZRC as a whole.

If your ZRC requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that ZRC as follow: `assets/zrc-X` (for zrc X). When linking to an image in the ZRC, use relative links such as `../assets/zrc-X/image.png`.

When you believe your ZRC is ready to progress past the 'Draft' phase, you should go to our [Zilliqa Official Discord](https://discord.gg/XMRE9tt) server and ask to have your issue added to the next community dev call where it can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community agrees to include it, the ZRC editors will update the state of your ZRC to 'Approved'.
